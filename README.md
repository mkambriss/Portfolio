- Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unveil critical trends, patterns, and underlying assumptions within the dataset.
- Analyzed and visualized stock price movements over time, with a specific focus on how end-of-quarter data influenced stock prices.
- Created Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) charts to depict stock data variations, including Volume, Open price, Close price, High, and Low.
- Engineered the date column into three distinct columns: &quot;Day,&quot; &quot;Month,&quot; and &quot;Year&quot; for further
analysis.
- Grouped data based on quarter-end dates to facilitate quarterly performance assessments.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBClassifier, to predict stock price movements.
- Utilized Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) analysis to measure prediction accuracy.
- Established and interpreted confusion matrices to validate model predictions.

### Dynamic Pricing Strategy Optimization

**Description**

In the dynamic pricing strategy optimization project, I spearheaded the development and implementation of a data-driven pricing strategy for a prominent ride-sharing platform. The primary goal was to dynamically adjust pricing in response to real-time variations in demand and supply levels, enhancing the platform's competitiveness and profitability.

**Key Achievements**

**Enhanced Pricing Strategy for Revenue Maximization:**

- Successfully enhanced the ride-sharing platform's pricing strategy to maximize revenue and maintain competitiveness in the market.

**Led Implementation of Critical Components:**

- As a key contributor, took charge of implementing crucial components that drove the project's success:

**Calculation of Demand and Supply Multipliers:**

- Developed algorithms to calculate demand and supply multipliers by comparing rider and driver counts with predefined percentiles. These calculations allowed real-time price adjustments based on market dynamics.
Adjusted Ride Cost Formulation:

- Devised a sophisticated formula for the adjusted ride cost, incorporating demand and supply multipliers, as well as caps and floors. This fine-tuned pricing mechanism ensured optimal pricing decisions.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Conducted a comprehensive EDA, unearthing insights into the intricate relationship between expected ride duration, historical ride cost, and various factors. These findings significantly informed our pricing strategies.
Profitability Analysis:

- Calculated the profitability of diverse ride types, enabling strategic focus on the most lucrative opportunities and maximizing overall profitability.

**Predictive Modeling:**

- Spearheaded the development and training of a Random Forest Regression model. This model accurately predicted optimal ride prices, further enhancing pricing precision and efficiency.

**Overcame Challenges:**

- Navigated and resolved various challenges throughout the project, including managing large volumes of real-time data, ensuring fair price adjustments for both riders and drivers, and optimizing algorithms for swift responses to changing market conditions.

**Impressive Outcomes:**

The project's dynamic pricing strategy implementation yielded remarkable results:

- Improved Pricing Accuracy: Achieved significant improvements in pricing accuracy, ensuring that prices better aligned with market demand and supply dynamics.

- Increased Revenue: Successfully boosted revenue generation, contributing to the platform's financial growth and sustainability.

- Enhanced User Experience: Elevated the overall user experience for both riders and drivers, fostering user loyalty and satisfaction.
